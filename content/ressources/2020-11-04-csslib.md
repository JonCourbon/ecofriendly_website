We chose the minimalist CSS framework: **Milligram** [https://milligram.io/](https://milligram.io/)
because:
- it's a minimal setup of styles
- it's only 2kb gzipped

It has some usefull functionnalities:
- The **Grid** is a fluid system with a max width of 112.0rem (1120px), that shrinks with the browser/device at smaller sizes. 

Drawbacks:
- Milligram uses the font-family Roboto (thus the font files must be loaded)
