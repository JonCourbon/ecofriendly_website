## Purging the CSS
Many CSS files (from frameworks) are used when coding a website. But in practise, only a small set of the framework is used, and a lot of unused CSS styles will be included. To reduce files size, it is desiderable to remove unused selectors from CSS, resulting in smaller CSS files. This can be done only in a post-process steps as it requires knowing required CSS !
