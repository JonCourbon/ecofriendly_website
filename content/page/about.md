We are teachers in the Departement "Métiers du Multimédia et de l'Internet" in the Université Clermont Auvergne (France) in the Campus of Le Puy-en-Velay. We train our students to the design of communication media including design and web technologies.
It is important that we address the hot topics:
- accessibility => design and develop media so that people with disabilities can use them
- eco-design => producing media that meet the customers' needs while using the minimum levels of resources and having a minimum impact on the environment and society

> The power of the Web is in its universality.
  Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.
 -- Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web
