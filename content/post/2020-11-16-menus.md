Instead of creating a single navigation menu positionned at top ... our bottom of the page for mobile devices, we use two menus.
<!--more-->

- Depending on the device, one of the two menus is hidden (visibility:hidden; display:none;)
- The bottom menu is different to the top menu: in config.toml, we have [[menu.main]] and [[menu.bottom]]. The bottom menu is shorter and has only important entries
- A new page called menu can be reached if more entries are required in the mobile phone version
