## Dark as default
As dark mode is the default, CSS has been changed such that "normal" CSS properties are properties for the dark mode. A "lightMode" class is added when switching to "light" mode and new properties have been added.

## Code
Instead of changing the mode at the end of the page loading, the "lightMode" class is added just after the body balise.

        <!-- check for mode in order to directly apply body class if required -->
        <script>function checkMode(){null===localStorage.getItem("lightMode")?setTimeout(function(){localStorage.setItem("lightMode","false")},100):"true"==localStorage.getItem("lightMode")&&document.body.classList.add("lightMode")}checkMode();</script>


## Design considerations
Elements are based on the post [https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/#design](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/#design).

- Color of the background: #121212 (recommandation of [https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html) for instance)
- Font Weight is lower for dark mode: font-weight: 350; (normal value: 400)
