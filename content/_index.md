## Introduction
The goal of the project is to build light-weight "eco" webdesites. The open-source static site generator `hugo` [https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/) has been chosen. Some of the goals are:
- assets optimisation,
- simple design...

This blog presents ressources that are used and details my progression to create a eco-friendly website !
